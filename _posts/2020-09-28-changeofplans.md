title: Change Of Plans

Note that there has been a slight change of plans. I'll still keep this older version of my webcomic up, maybe also intigrate all the posts into the current webcomic that exists over here: http://uploadedfairywebcomic.glitch.me/

To view the lower link, you need to have IPFS on:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch?hl=en
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/

You will also need the IPFS client to turn on the daemon:
https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/

Once you have it installed, simply initialize it ( only needs to be done once ):
~~~
ipfs init
~~~

Then type:
~~~
ipfs daemon
~~~

But I'm also going to be scanning in the new drawing style, which is closer to a Bande Dessinnee and Manga fusion. This will be what I call "Album Digest" mode. The strips are drawn length wise on 12 width and 9 height paper, and shrunk to 8 width and 5 height. ( Inches. )

This means the scenes will flow a little bit differently.

In the mean time you can look at some of my concept art:
